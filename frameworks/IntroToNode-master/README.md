Intro To Node
============

The Intro To Node slides were built with [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/).

The webserver was built for Node.js using the [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) web server framework.
Prerequisites include Node.js and NPM(Node Package Manager). After NPM is installed, run 'npm install' in this directory to install the dependencies specified in the package.json file.
[See here](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) for an introduction to NPM.
After dependencies are installed with NPM, you can run the webserver with 'sudo node app.js', or 'node app.js' if you specify an unrestricted port (port 3000 is usually safe).

This git repository is ready to be pushed to a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) dyno for free hosting! [Set one up now](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs).
